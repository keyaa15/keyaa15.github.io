        <h1>Hi Kirsten, happy new year :)</h1>
        <p>I’ve been wanting to say this for a while, but I don’t know how to start it. I’ve been stopping myself from telling you this because I thought it might get weird between us. But at the same time, keeping it all to myself has been driving me insane. I’ve come to realize that I like you, more than just a friend. Corny ba? Sorry, hindi ko kasi alam kung paano ko sasabihin. I want to tell you the truth to give you assurance, because love shouldn't be confusing. Hindi naman ako takot sa rejections; I know na not everything works out and that feelings aren't always mutual. Sobrang torpe ko ba? Ewan ko, tumitiklop kasi ako kapag nandiyan ka sa paligid ko. I want to give you the love that is gentle and patient. ‘Yung love na hindi nagmamadali, hindi nananakit, at hindi umaalis kapag nagiging mabigat na ang nararamdaman. I want to know you in your barest form, because knowing you in that form means choosing you without any illusions. I want to love you in a way that's soft, gentle, genuine, and safe. And if loving you is a sin, then I’d gladly walk through the fires of hell as long as it means that I can love you for eternity. I am willing to lower my pride just to understand you when things are rough. I will always be with you, not physically but emotionally. I'm saying this not because I'm expecting something in return; however, I'm saying this because you deserve to know that you mean something to someone. Before the year's end, confessing to you is the last risk I'm willing to take. And if loving you means losing everything and everyone I’ve ever loved, then I’d willingly lose them just to be with the person I love. I’m nervous as I write this because I value the closeness we have, and I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable. This may sound corny, but you’ve become my favorite part of my day. I hope this won’t be cringe to you. Sana kaya pa kitang harapin sa monday, at sana hindi na ako torpe. Hindi kita minamadali, lods. Kung sa tingin mong masyadong mabilis, okay lang. Kung hindi ka pa sure sa nararamdaman mo, you can just ignore this message. Maghihintay ako ng sagot mo hanggang sa ready ka na. Happy new year ulit, lods. </p>
        <p>Here's a song that reminds me of you: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2Q3Yvc2Tw3VqGIBjuCIzvW?si=cdba2e86c8534cde" target="_blank">Listen Here</a></p>
        <p>I hope our closeness stays the same :)</p>
